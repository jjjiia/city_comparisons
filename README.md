# city_comparisons
work in progress

maps for comparing between 2 or more areas within a city or pairs of cities based on census data

this series of maps includes 3 formats:

1. fractures draws boundaries where the differences between areas are greatest to show inequalities
2. variances shows diversity of areas compared to a city average
3. comparisons shows corresponding areas with similar income/rent/data-field/etc characteristics between 2 cities and is inspired by cost of living calculator http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/
